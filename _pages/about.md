## Biography

I am an **experimental particle physicist** working on the **J-PET** (Jagiellonian-PET) project – a novel total-body PET scanner built from plastic scintillators. My research bridges **nuclear reaction modeling** (spallation, fusion, non-equilibrium processes) and **medical imaging** (positronium imaging, quantum-entanglement studies, proton-therapy range monitoring).

I defended my PhD in 2016 at Jagiellonian University under the supervision of **Prof. Bogusław Kamys** with the thesis **“Validation of Spallation Models”**. Since then I have contributed to more than **70 publications**, many in collaboration with the J-PET team, CERN (AEgIS), and other international groups.

### Research interests
- **Positronium imaging** and lifetime spectroscopy  
- **Total-body PET** with plastic scintillators (J-PET)  
- **Monte-Carlo simulations** (GATE, GEANT4, toy MC)  
- **Spallation & nuclear-reaction models** (p+Al, p+Ag, p+Au at GeV energies)  
- **Quantum tests** – photon entanglement, CPT & time-reversal symmetry  
- **Proton-therapy range verification** and **neutron-based detection** (SABAT)
