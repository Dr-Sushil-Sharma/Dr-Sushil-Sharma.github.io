I'm a particle physicist with a decade of work on positron physics, nuclear reactions, and medical imaging. Currently, I'm focused on the **J-PET** project – developing the first total-body PET scanner based on plastic scintillators. The system costs less than crystal-based alternatives, achieves longer axial coverage, and enables **positronium imaging** in living tissue. We're measuring quantum states inside the human body.

My work began with modeling nuclear reactions – spallation, fusion, and non-equilibrium processes in GeV proton-nucleus collisions. I defended my PhD in 2016 under **Prof. Bogusław Kamys** with a thesis titled **"Validation of Spallation Models"**, testing Monte Carlo transport codes against experimental data from p+Al, p+Ag, and p+Au systems. Since then, I've co-authored **over 70 publications** across nuclear physics and medical imaging, working between Kraków, CERN (AEgIS collaboration), and other research facilities.

### Current research directions

- **Positronium imaging**: Mapping formation and decay of positronium in tissue to probe microstructure and molecular environment
- **Fundamental symmetries in PET**: Testing CPT invariance and time-reversal symmetry using entangled photon pairs from positron annihilation
- **Scintillator instrumentation**: Long-strip plastic detectors with multi-threshold readout and time-of-flight reconstruction

I spend considerable time in GATE and GEANT4 simulations, but the most satisfying moments come from seeing experimental data confirm what the models predicted – or, better yet, finding something unexpected.
